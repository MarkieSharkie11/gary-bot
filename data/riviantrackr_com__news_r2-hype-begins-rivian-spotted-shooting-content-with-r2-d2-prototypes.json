  "text": "Skip to content\nLooks like Rivian is starting to roll out the R2 hype machine.\nA Reddit user spotted a convoy of R2 prototypes cruising down a California highway, and these aren’t the usual low-key test vehicles. Instead, they’re rocking bright accent colors like orange and yellow across the rear light bar and trim.\nIf that sounds familiar, it’s because they look very similar to the R2-D2 themed R2 we saw at Autonomy Day. That one had a playful, character-inspired look, and now it seems Rivian is experimenting with more colorful variants, likely for upcoming content.\nThis feels like the early stages of Rivian’s official R2 media push. We’re starting to see more sightings, more personality, and less camouflage, which usually means the marketing rollout is right around the corner.\nIn other words, the R2 content era might be about to begin.\nR2 Promos? byu/Own_Airport6086 inRivian\n One comment \n I’m surprised to see yellow in the mix…is Compass Yellow about to make a comeback? Might make me consider an R2 after all!\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
