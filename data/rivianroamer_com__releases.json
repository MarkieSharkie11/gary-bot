Whether it's a weekend getaway or a cross-country road trip, you'll know exactly how your Rivian performed.\n Now you can filter your drive sessions by your wheel and tire configurations.\nAs well as sort by new elevation-related data. Sort by most elevation gain/loss, net elevation gain/loss and highest/lowest points.\n This action cannot be undone.\n Cancel\n Confirm",
