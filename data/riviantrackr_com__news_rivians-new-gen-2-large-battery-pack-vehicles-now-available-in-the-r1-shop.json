For those in the market for a new R1T or R1S, this is a great time to explore Rivian’s latest battery offerings. These new Gen 2 Large battery packs provide plenty of range and performance, catering to various driving needs.\nA selection of Large (or maybe Large+) Gen 2 R1T\nHowever, as RivianTrackr has previously mentioned, you might also come across some remaining “Large+” battery vehicles in the shop. These are actually Max battery pack vehicles that are software-limited to the capacity of a Large pack. The catch? Rivian doesn’t explicitly tell you whether you’re purchasing a Large or Large+ battery pack, making it tricky to know exactly what you’re getting.\nBut don’t worry—we’ve got you covered! Our friends at Rivian Roamer have taken the guesswork out of the equation by creating a helpful filter that lets you see the difference between Large and Large+ battery types. So, if you’re curious about which battery pack your desired vehicle has, head over to Rivian Roamer to check out their filter and make an informed decision before you buy.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
