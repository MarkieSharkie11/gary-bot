  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian has quietly updated its European R2 page, and the change is subtle but important. The previous language pointing to a 2027 arrival in Europe is gone. Now, the page simply invites visitors to sign up for updates, with no timeline attached.\nOn its own, that might not mean much. But paired with the recent shift in Canada, where R2 moved to a 2027 launch window and pricing was removed, the pattern becomes harder to ignore. Rivian is clearly tightening its focus around a successful US launch first, and everything else appears to be falling in line behind that priority.\nThis makes sense strategically. R2 is the vehicle that has to scale. It is Rivian’s first true high volume play, built in Illinois, and the company cannot afford a messy rollout. If production is constrained in the early years, the US will naturally take priority, where Rivian already has infrastructure, service, and brand momentum. Expanding into Europe adds regulatory complexity, logistics, service expansion, and potentially right hand drive planning for the UK. That is a lot to layer on during an aggressive ramp.\nWhat makes this interesting is that R2 was clearly designed with Europe in mind. European pedestrian safety regulations heavily influence front end design, and Rivian specifically shaped the hood, or bonnet, to comply with EU impact standards while making it part of the vehicle’s identity. The proportions, size class, and overall footprint of R2 also position it well for European urban markets compared to R1. So this was never an afterthought market.\nThere is no official confirmation that Europe is delayed beyond 2027, but removing a date usually signals uncertainty rather than acceleration. If Canada is now 2027 and the US launch is the clear priority, it would not be surprising to see Europe shift to 2028 or later.\nFor now, European fans are left with a sign up form and patience, while Rivian puts all of its energy into getting R2 right at home first.\n 3 Comments \n It makes sense since the Georgia plant doesn’t come online until 2028. Their goal this year is 20-25k units in the US. The Normal plant wouldn’t be able to handle the US and European markets next year.\n Normal plant has a capacity for what? Did I read at one time 150,000 units? Or is capacity limited by the Amazon van production needs?\n And my friends from Europe are asking me if I’m willing to sale my R2 already …\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
