  "text": "Skip to content\nThis week, Rivian invited a variety of media outlets and influencers out to get hands on with the R2 validation builds and while Rivian is still playing things close to the chest on specs, pricing, final trims, and the nitty gritty details, this is the first time we’re seeing R2 through the eyes of people in the real world.\nValidation builds are not marketing fluff. This is the stage where a vehicle is being tested, refined, and stress checked before full scale production. Panel gaps, suspension tuning, software calibration, off road geometry, ride comfort, steering feel, all of that is being dialed in. When Rivian lets media drive vehicles at this phase, it signals confidence.\nFrom what’s been shared so far, the biggest takeaway is that R2 feels very Rivian. That sounds simple, but it’s actually huge. R2 is supposed to be the more accessible, higher volume Rivian, but not a watered down one. Early impressions suggest the steering is tight, the ride is composed, and the off road capability is not just a bullet point. Multiple attendees pushed it on dirt and uneven terrain, and the vehicle did not look like it was pretending.\nThat’s important because R2 is going to live in a very different battlefield than R1. This is Model Y territory. This is high volume crossover land. This is where pricing, packaging, and driving experience collide. Rivian cannot afford for R2 to feel like a compromise. It needs to feel intentional.\nWe’ll continue tracking every video and article from the invite list below, because right now this is the clearest window we have into what R2 will actually feel like when it hits driveways. Specs will come. Pricing will come. Trim breakdowns will come.\nInsideEV’s article\nCar and Driver’s article\n 4 Comments \n They should have included you.\n Thank you Jose for publishing all this really helpful R2 news!!!!!\n I’ll definitely be replacing my Ioniq 5 with the R2 once its lease is up next spring. It’ll look good next to the R1T. I do have one concern though: that hidden rear wiper. Unless it is heated, I can see it getting covered in ice, making it unusable. It seems like one of those features (like the power door handles and R1T retractable tonneau) that look cool but were clearly not designed or tested by anyone that experiences real winters.\n I wonder if he will get the UI update.. It would be awesome to get the fan/ac controls on right steering wheel button like the r2. is it even possible?\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
