  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian just dropped a fresh batch of R2 manufacturing clips, and if there was any doubt, the R2 hype train is officially rolling. In the short video clips, Rivian gives us a behind the scenes look at how the upcoming R2 is coming together, highlighting what they call a “simplified design” that makes it easier to build and scale.\nFront and center is the familiar white R2 we first saw in the early prototype reveals about two years ago. But this time, it’s not just sitting under studio lights. We’re getting quick cuts of motors, interior components, and various stages of the vehicle coming together on the line. It’s the kind of footage that feels less like a concept tease and more like a real product getting ready for prime time.\nWhat stands out most is the focus on manufacturability. Rivian is clearly leaning into the idea that R2 is designed from day one to be easier and cheaper to produce at scale, which is exactly what needs to happen if they want to hit their target pricing and volumes.\nBetween the recent sightings of R2 test vehicles, themed prototypes, and now actual manufacturing clips, it feels like Rivian is slowly turning up the volume on R2 content. If this is the start of the official R2 rollout campaign, things are about to get a lot more interesting.\n One comment \n Cheaper to manufacture is good but cheaper to service would be great too. Why don’t car companies talk that up?\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
