  "text": "Skip to content\nA short clip shared by Scot from Out of Spec shows her Rivian R1S (Gen 2) confidently handling lane centering and a lane change in snowy conditions, and it hits a little harder when you put it in context. Snow covered roads are where driver assistance systems tend to struggle most, yet the vehicle stays composed and completes the maneuver smoothly.\nWhat makes this especially notable is the comparison everyone inevitably makes. Tesla has had years of development, millions of vehicles on the road, and an enormous amount of real world data feeding its driver assistance systems. Rivian, on the other hand, has only been seriously building and rolling out its current driver assistance stack for a matter of months, with a far smaller fleet generating data.\nRivian ADAS lane centering and changing lanes in the snow! pic.twitter.com/xOXedKyyWA— Not Scot (@OOSScot) January 31, 2026\nDespite that gap, clips like this show Rivian making rapid progress. This is not about claiming parity or superiority, but about trajectory. Seeing stable, predictable behavior in poor winter conditions so early in the lifecycle is a strong signal that Rivian’s approach is maturing quickly.\nIt is a reminder that while experience and scale matter, smart iteration and focused development can close the gap faster than many people expect.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
