  "text": "AI Policy for Rivian Roamer\n Effective Date: February 5, 2026\n Key Points (tl;dr)\n Here's what actually matters:\n AI assists development, it doesn't replace engineering - Every feature is designed, reviewed, tested, and shipped by a human engineer\n Your data is never sent to AI models - Vehicle telematics, location, personal information, and account data stay on our servers\n AI-enriched features will be clearly marked - If we introduce features powered by AI, you'll know and you can opt out\n One human is accountable - A real engineer owns every decision, not an algorithm\n How AI Is Used in Development\n AI tools are used as coding assistants during development, the same way an engineer might use a calculator, documentation, or a spell checker. These tools help with writing code, catching bugs, and exploring solutions faster.\n What AI does not do:\n Make product decisions\n Ship code without human review and testing\n Access production systems or customer data\n Replace engineering judgment or accountability\n Every line of code that reaches production is reviewed, tested, and approved by a professional software engineer. AI accelerates the work. It does not do the work unsupervised.\n How AI Is Used with Your Data\n It isn't.\n Your vehicle telematics, location history, driving data, personal information, and account details are never sent to third-party AI models or large language models. Your data stays on our infrastructure, processed by our code, under our control.\n AI-Enriched Features\n If we introduce features that use AI to enhance your experience (such as efficiency recommendations, trip suggestions, or predictive insights), we commit to the following:\n Clearly marked: AI-powered features will be identified so you know when AI is involved\n Opt-out available: You will always have the option to disable AI-enriched features\n Policy updated first: This policy will be updated before any AI-powered features launch\n Data handling disclosed: We will explain exactly what data is used and how\n As of today, Rivian Roamer has no customer-facing AI-powered features.\n Human Accountability\n Rivian Roamer is built and operated by a single engineer. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for this product. AI is a tool in the toolbox, not a substitute for care, judgment, or accountability to the people who trust us with their data.\n Changes to This Policy\n If our use of AI changes materially, we will update this policy and notify customers before those changes take effect. You can always find the current version of this policy here.\n Questions?\n Email us at support@rivianroamer.com\n This action cannot be undone.\n Cancel\n Confirm",
