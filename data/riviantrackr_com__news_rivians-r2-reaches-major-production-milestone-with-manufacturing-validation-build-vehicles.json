  "text": "Skip to content\nJust a year ago, Rivian’s R2 expansion in Normal, IL was nothing more than a concrete slab. Today, Rivian has hit a major milestone, the first R2 Manufacturing Validation Build vehicles have officially rolled off the line.\nThese are not prototypes or show cars. Manufacturing Validation Builds are production-intent vehicles, designed to validate factory processes, tooling, and build quality ahead of full-scale production. In short, this is Rivian proving it can build R2 at scale.\nTo mark the moment, Rivian is sending one of these first R2 MVBs on a real-world road trip along historic Route 66. Instead of keeping it behind factory doors, Rivian is putting R2 out on America’s roads, stopping at iconic landmarks along the “Mother Road” and sharing the journey on social media.\nThe timeline here is worth noting. Rivian went from a bare concrete foundation to a production-ready R2 line in under 12 months. That kind of speed matters, especially with R2 positioned as the vehicle that will help Rivian scale into a higher-volume automaker.\nRivian says this milestone keeps R2 on track for production ramp-up and customer deliveries in the first half of this year. There is still work ahead, but Manufacturing Validation Build is a clear signal that R2 is moving from plans to reality.\nIf you see an R2 cruising Route 66 soon, it is not just a road trip. It is Rivian’s next chapter hitting the pavement.\n 15 Comments \n Do you know of their timing?
