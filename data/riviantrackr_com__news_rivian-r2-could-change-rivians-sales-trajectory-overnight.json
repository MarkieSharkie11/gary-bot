  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian’s R2 has not even launched yet, but there is a very real chance it could outsell the R1 lineup faster than almost anyone expects.\nR1 proved that Rivian could build a compelling vehicle. It was expensive, large, and aimed squarely at early adopters who were willing to live with rough edges. R2 is different. It is designed for people who have been watching Rivian from the sidelines, waiting for something that felt attainable.\nThat group is much bigger than many realize.\nFor years, the biggest blocker to buying a Rivian has been price, not interest. You see it constantly in comments, forums, and social posts. “I love Rivian, but it’s too expensive.” R2 directly attacks that problem in a way R1 never could.\nR2 also lands at exactly the right size. It is large enough to feel useful, but not so big that it feels excessive. For many buyers, especially those coming from crossovers like the Model Y, CR-V, or RAV4, R2 feels familiar instead of aspirational. That matters more than horsepower numbers or 0 to 60 times.\nThere is also a timing advantage that R1 never had. Rivian is no longer an unknown startup. There are hundreds of thousands of R1s on the road, real owners sharing real experiences, and a brand that now feels established rather than experimental. R2 benefits from all of that credibility without having to earn it from scratch.\nWord of mouth is going to do heavy lifting here. R1 owners are already acting as unpaid ambassadors, and many of them are exactly the people friends and family trust when asking, “Should I go electric?” R2 gives those conversations a much easier recommendation.\nThen there is the competitive landscape. R2 does not need to dominate spec sheets to win. It needs to feel better thought out, better designed, and more cohesive than the sea of mid size electric crossovers. Rivian has consistently shown it understands how to build an emotional connection with owners, and that translates directly into sales volume when the price barrier drops.\nCould Rivian stumble? Absolutely. Service capacity, delivery execution, and software polish will matter more than ever at this scale. But if Rivian executes even reasonably well, R2 is positioned to move from niche success to mainstream volume faster than R1 ever did.\nR1 made Rivian credible. R2 could make it big.\n 11 Comments \n R1 was the flagship Rivian vehicle that served as the formal “Handshake” to the whole World.\nR2 will be the “everyone’s” car. \nBy the time R2 rolls out for sale, buyers will get to choose between a $50K new R2 or a $50K used R1.\n I agree the R2 could be Rivian’s M3/Y moment. R1’s could soon go the way of Model S/X. Rivian needs to address some, issues now before R2 rollout: Customer experience from Sales and delivery to Service. I was aware of issues and chose to go forward anyway but still found sales and delivery disjointed and frustrating. Service has been hit and miss, when I get to talk to a real life tech things are great up to that point not so much. Delivery was a paperwork and scheduling nightmare. I was scheduled to pick up had transportation to the delivery center scheduled ( 3 hours away) and the delivery team called at 1:30 pm the day before to say the truck was not there and would not be for another week.\n If the R2 being rolled out in 2 phases, I wonder how many people are waiting for Gen 3?\n I’ve struggled a bit with that as a Day 1 reservation holder. A lot depends on the timeline for the Gen 3 update. But I’m thinking the self-driving software may take another 2-3 years to reach full capability regardless of the underlying tech. So I’m strongly considering leasing the First Edition for 2 or 3 years, then upgrading to Gen 3.\n R2 is the $45K affordable EV that looks like it will be introduced at $55K to $60K. Rivian, if you are going to make an affordable EV, then just do it\n Unfortunately the upper trims always come before the base.\n As an employee who has worked there for over 30 years ( 27 with Mitsubishi ) I believe we need to do alot more marketing for R2. I mean mainstream TV advertising.\n With 200,000 reservations, even if half fall out, that’s still at least a year or more of a production backlog until the full ramp up. The marketing push should start in earnest when the production curve is approaching the demand curve. Building demand that can’t be fulfilled just annoys prospective buyers and wastes money and resources. There are plenty of Tesla Model Y owners like myself that are looking for their next mid-size EV, so the timing is perfect without the need to spend on mass marketing that goes to tens of millions of people that aren’t in the target market.\n Sad to say… There are unaddressed issues with all Rivians with navigating dependability and data accuracy. All assisted and self drive features depend on having accurate navigation which Rivian lack. All Rivian owners know that but ignores because of the vehicle’s all other greatness. Rivian mist fix navigation before aiming high.\n A key spec for the R2 is that there is no ‘Musk’ involved.\n The biggest issue with sales that I see is the cost of electricity to charge is going to skyrocket over the next few years while the cost of gasoline is going to continue to fall (for the next few years, anyway).\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
