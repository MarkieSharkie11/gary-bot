  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian has officially partnered with Pantone to standardize its signature color, now known as Rivian Green, and the timing matters. As Rivian prepares to launch R2 and reach a much broader audience, locking in a consistent visual identity is a clear signal of what is coming next.\nRivian Green traces its roots back to the factory floor during early R1 development, inspired by the raw green tone of E-coat. That industrial yet organic color evolved into Launch Green and quickly became one of the most recognizable parts of the Rivian brand. It struck a balance between nature and engineering, shifting between deep forest tones and technical gray depending on the light.\nBy formalizing Rivian Green with Pantone, Rivian can now reproduce that color accurately across vehicles, interiors, retail spaces, and digital experiences. This level of precision becomes especially important with R2, where higher volume production and a wider range of materials make consistency harder to maintain.\nWhile Rivian has not confirmed exact R2 color options, this move strongly suggests that Rivian Green will carry over to R2. Standardizing the color now makes it easier to scale it across a new platform without losing the character that defined Rivian’s early vehicles.\nAs R2 approaches, Rivian Green feels less like a legacy color and more like a foundation. Expect it to play a visible role in how R2 introduces Rivian’s design language to a new generation of owners.\n 8 Comments \n I wonder if Compass Yellow will get the same love?\n They flatter themselves. They don’t have good colors, they have expensive flat Crayola colors. As just ok as their green is, it lacks dimension and makes the vehicle seem top heavy.\n I don’t know what you’re smoking, man. Are you AI?\n just grumpy that my R1S craps the bed all the time and is in constant need of service to replace faulty hardware.\n That sucks man, I hope at some point you can enjoy it again.\n Whatever. Launch Green is rather bland. It may be the only color for the R2 Launch Edition with other colors available a couple months after launch. Rivian should offer that forest wrap as an option.\n I’m happy they’re locking in the color. Rivians looks stunning on the road.\nI can tell it’s a rivian from 2 miles away 😁\n Great to hear them celebrating their legacy and this lovely hue. I love seeing those chunky launch green trucks rolling around.\nI love their color palette. So many boring cars and colors; nice to see Rivian brining the nature inspired variety.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
