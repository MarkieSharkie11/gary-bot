  "text": "Skip to content\nFor the first time ever, Rivian is offering 0% APR, and yeah, that is kind of a big deal.\nRivian just dropped its lowest financing offer to date on new 2026 R1 vehicles. Buyers can snag 0% APR for 60 months on the R1 Dual with Large or Max Performance, plus the Tri and Quad configurations. Zero interest. Five years. That is something we have never been able to say about Rivian financing before.\nUp until now, Rivian incentives have mostly lived in lease land or short-term promos. This changes the conversation entirely for buyers who actually want to own their R1 long term. With interest rates being what they are these days, 0% APR can easily mean thousands of dollars staying in your pocket instead of going to a bank.\nDelivery has to happen by March 31, 2026.\nIf you are now wondering whether buying finally makes more sense than leasing, you are not alone. A quick shoutout here to Travis Ketchum, who built an excellent Rivian Lease vs Buy calculator that lets you compare both options side by side. It is a great way to sanity-check the numbers before making a decision.\nBottom line, this feels like a confidence move from Rivian and one of the strongest ownership incentives they have ever offered on the R1 lineup.\nAnd if you want help navigating the process or want me to connect you with an awesome Rivian sales rep, just email me at [email protected] and I will help get things moving.\n 2 Comments \n No son profecionales tengo un año queried comprar una y no contestan los correos es frustante\n Si quieres ponerte en contacto conmigo, ¡puedo ayudarte a conectarte con alguien que pueda ayudarte a responder preguntas!\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
