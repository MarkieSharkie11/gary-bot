  "title": "Doug DeMuro Says Rivian R2 Pricing Is “Quite Compelling” Ahead of March 12 Reveal",
  "text": "Skip to content\nDoug DeMuro just added more fuel to the R2 fire, and if you thought the hype was already high, it just went up another notch.\nAfter getting seat time in a validation build of the Rivian R2, Doug was visibly excited in his initial coverage, and that enthusiasm translated into a Doug Score of 70. For context, that puts the R2 just one point behind the R1S in his scoring system, which is kind of wild when you think about what R1S represents in Rivian’s lineup today. For a smaller, more affordable vehicle that has not even officially launched yet to land that close says a lot about how polished this thing already feels.\nWhat really caught my attention though was what Doug said afterward on his podcast, This Car Pod!. He mentioned that he has seen R2 pricing and described it as “quite compelling” for the launch edition Dual Motor. No numbers, no breakdown, just that phrase. But coming from someone who looks at car pricing all day, every day, and understands market positioning better than most, that comment carries weight.\nThere has been nonstop speculation about where Rivian will land on price. We have heard everything from low $50,000s to creeping close to $60,000 once you spec it out. Personally, I am planting my flag around $55,000 for the launch edition Dual Motor. That would thread the needle perfectly. It keeps R2 clearly below R1 pricing, undercuts a lot of similarly equipped EV SUVs, and still gives Rivian room to protect margins, which we all know is critical as they scale.\nAnd this is where it gets interesting strategically. If Doug is calling the pricing compelling, that suggests Rivian is not overshooting. They understand that R2 is not just another model, it is the volume play. This is the vehicle that has to compete in the heart of the EV market, not in the premium adventure niche where R1 lives. If they get pricing right at launch, it changes the entire narrative from “cool new Rivian” to “serious Model Y alternative.”\nMarch 12 is when we get the real answers, with full pricing, specs, and options expected to be revealed. Until then, we are reading between the lines, but the signals so far are strong. A 70 Doug Score, glowing first impressions, and early whispers of compelling pricing are exactly the kind of breadcrumbs you want to see if you are rooting for R2 to be a breakout success.\n 3 Comments \n Here’s my take. The 2026 R2 LE (AWD with max pack battery) will be $55K+delivery and include all options with choice or paint color, interior upgrades & choice or color, rims/tires and audio upgrade (no LiDAR and no possibility to upgrade down the road).\nA few months later the 2026 R2 with RWD and standard battery will launch for $45K+delivery (also, no LiDAR). All options will be extra (paint, interior, audio).\nThe 2027 model will follow once the LE is sold out and also start at $55K for AWD+max pack but everything will be extra like paint, interior material and color, rims+tires, audio upgrade, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if the AWD+max pack upgrade was packaged together as a single option for basically $10K in the beginning to reduce SKUs.\nThis is how they will entice people to buy the LE instead of waiting for the 2027 LiDAR model.\nIf they price it much higher they loose more sales to BMW and Volvo (at the luxury end) and Toyota and Subaru (at the low end).\n Here’s my guess! The 2026 R2 Launch Edition will be a Dual Motor with a Long Range Pack that has 330 miles of range. It will be 50k, come with standard 20″ tires that are smaller than what we’ve seen so far, and options will include: different tire/rims with the largest being the 32″ tires we’ve seen, different paint colors, and a choice of a black interior or a light interior. If you go with the largest 32″ tires/rims it will increase the price and a fully decked out LE will end at 55k. When looking at the 2027 R2 all variants will have LiDAR, but it will be a separate optional $2.5k software unlock. The standard entry trim will be 45k, be RWD, and have a Standard Battery pack. The mid trim (Dual Motor) will then have Standard and Long Range Battery options and will start at 47.5k and 50k respectively. Tri motor variants will be sold with a max pack, will include different wheels, and have a unique interior and/or exterior color option. Tri will start at 56k because it’s an enthusiast trim, not a requirement for family driving. This breakdown assumes Rivian wants the dual motor version (which will likely be the most popular) to live in the range of 47.5k – 52.5k so it can capture just below the current average vehicle cost in America of 50k, at the current average cost, and just above. And by having it right at the heart of this average it’s “quite compelling” because regular folks like myself will look to choose Rivian over the Honda CRVs and Rav4s of the world.\n Hoping that Rivian score a hit with the R2. With the hype and low-ball pricing (typical marketing gig), we all would like Rivian to break out of its shell. However, another variable is if ever the Chinese EVs could market their product here in US, I think it is game over. You just cannot compete with the Chinese EVs on price and quality. There is no such thing in US that you can produce both a cheap variant and quality EV. The Chinese are known to be able to do it. They were able to produce cheap products that flood the global markets. Now, they are even able to produce cheap products WITH quality and that is a real constraint for US manufacturers.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
