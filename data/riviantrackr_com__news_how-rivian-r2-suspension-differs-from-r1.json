  "title": "How Rivian R2 Suspension Differs From R1",
  "text": "Skip to content\nWhen Rivian revealed the R2, most of the conversation focused on pricing and size, but one of the biggest differences between R2 and R1 is actually underneath the vehicle, in the way each one handles suspension.\nR2 launches with a semi-active suspension system built around traditional coil springs, paired with electronically controlled dampers that can adjust stiffness depending on the drive mode, which means the vehicle can feel firmer and more controlled when you want sharper handling, or softer and more comfortable when you are just cruising or dealing with rough pavement. It does not raise or lower itself like an air suspension system, but it does actively adapt how the vehicle rides and responds, giving Rivian room to tune comfort and control without adding unnecessary complexity.\nThe Rivian R1 platform take things much further, using independent air suspension along with an electro hydraulic roll control system that replaces a traditional anti-roll bar, allowing the vehicle to adjust ride height for efficiency, entry, and serious off-road clearance, while also staying impressively flat in corners despite their size. It is a more advanced and more expensive setup, designed to deliver maximum flexibility and capability.\nR2’s approach is simpler by design, and that is not a downgrade, it is a strategic move. Most buyers in this segment are not constantly changing ride height or pushing the limits off-road, but they still want something that feels planted, comfortable, and capable, and a well tuned semi-active coil system can deliver exactly that without the added cost and complexity of air suspension.\nIn the end, the difference comes down to purpose. R1 showcases Rivian’s most advanced engineering, while R2 translates that DNA into a more focused, scalable package built for higher volume and everyday use, without losing the confident, adventure ready character that defines the brand.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
