  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian just made a quiet little shuffle in the paint booth, and if you were eyeing that purple, you might want to move fast.\nBack on December 3, 2025, Rivian introduced the limited-edition Borealis color, a bold purple that instantly stood out in a sea of greens, grays, and blues. It was one of those colors that you either loved or really didn’t love, and it quickly picked up a fan base among owners who wanted something a bit more playful.\nAs of yesterday, Borealis has officially disappeared from the online configurator. The good news is it’s not completely gone just yet. There are still a handful of Borealis vehicles floating around in the R1 Shop, so if that purple was calling your name, this is likely your last chance.\nOn the flip side, there’s a bit of a color comeback story. Back in August 2025, we reported that Red Canyon had quietly vanished from the configurator. Now we can confirm it’s back and available to select again.\nSo the color carousel keeps spinning. Borealis bows out, Red Canyon steps back in, and Rivian continues to mix things up. If you want something different from the usual palette, it’s always worth keeping an eye on the configurator, because these changes can happen pretty fast.\nCould Borealis make a return for R2? Stay tuned…\n One comment \n I just noticed that last night – that I could not configure one in purple. Kind of disappointing they didn’t keep it around longer, tbh. 😢\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
