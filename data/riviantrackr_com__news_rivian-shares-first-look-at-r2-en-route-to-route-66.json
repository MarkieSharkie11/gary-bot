  "text": "Skip to content\nNot long after Rivian confirmed that manufacturing validation builds of R2 are rolling off the line in Normal, Illinois, the company shared a new Instagram video showing one of those vehicles heading out to Route 66.\nWhile short, the clip revealed several interesting details. The R2 features an auto-closing rear trunk, a Gear Guard inspired camo wrap, and a noticeably active, bouncy suspension as it tackles uneven terrain. The video also shows its first charging stop at a Rivian Adventure Network site, reinforcing that R2 is fully integrated into Rivian’s charging ecosystem.\nA few subtle design touches stood out as well, including door handles that pop out as the door opens (I personally wasn’t sure if this would come to R2) and what appears to be a capacitive touch area for opening the front trunk rather than a traditional latch.\nIt was not a formal feature reveal, but seeing a manufacturing validation R2 out in the real world, driving, charging, and being used as intended, is another strong signal that Rivian is moving quickly toward launch.\nRivian has shared a video on Instagram of the R2 heading on an adventure on Route 66! pic.twitter.com/tLNQM9Ago0— Jose | RivianTrackr (@RivianTrackr) January 17, 2026\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
