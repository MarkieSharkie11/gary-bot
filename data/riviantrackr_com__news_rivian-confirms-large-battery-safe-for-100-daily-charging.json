  "text": "Skip to content\nIn a recent confirmation on Reddit, Rivian’s Chief Software Officer, Wassym Bensaid, verified that the new Large+ battery is indeed a software-locked version of the Max pack. This development aligns with previous reports on RivianTrackr, which noted that the Large+ battery can safely be charged to 100%.\nWassym also shared that the Large+ battery also features different charging and regen characteristics. We don’t know what this means until we can run charging tests on the Large+ battery pack.\nScreenshot\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
