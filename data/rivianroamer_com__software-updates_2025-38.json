Touch the eerie scene in the All-Purpose drive mode screen on the center display. Can you find what’s lurking? Dress your car up in its costume to enter a world of spooky images, foreboding sounds, and ghastly lights! Is that a frog I hear? Yikes! A swamp monster!To don the costume:Update the Rivian mobile app on your phone to version 3.6.0.Place the vehicle in P (Park), and make sure it has more than 30 miles of range.Turn off Pet Comfort and Vehicle Shipping mode (if they’re on).Make sure to have WiFi or cellular reception on the vehicle and on your phone.Tap Let's Get Spooky on the main screen of the Rivian mobile app to dive in!NOTESWhile car costume is on, passive entry and the horn are disabled, and range decreases slightly.Car costume stays on after you leave the vehicle, so turn it off through the mobile app (or press the brake pedal) if you want to preserve the vehicle battery.Climate ImprovementsClimate Hold is a new setting that runs the climate system for a set amount of time after you exit the vehicle, maintaining cabin temperatures while you're away, and keeping any remaining occupants comfortable. Use the Rivian mobile app to monitor climate status, the Hold time remaining, and to turn Hold on or off.DANGER: Never leave a child unattended in the vehicle.NOTE: When leaving pets alone in the vehicle, use Pet Comfort instead of Hold as it has specific behaviors meant to keep your pets as safe and comfortable as possible.Auto cabin ventilation is a new setting that automatically blows ambient air into the parked vehicle on warm days to help prevent extremely high temperatures in the cabin. This feature is on by default, and notifies you in the Rivian mobile app when it's running.
