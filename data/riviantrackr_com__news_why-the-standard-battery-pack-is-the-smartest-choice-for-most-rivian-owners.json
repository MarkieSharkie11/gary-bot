  "text": "Skip to content\nPicking a battery for your Rivian? It’s easy to think more range is always better, but that’s not always the case. The Standard pack uses LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, which are tougher, last longer, and don’t degrade as quickly—especially if you fast charge a lot. Plus, it’s cheaper and easier to live with. Unless you’re constantly road-tripping to the middle of nowhere, it might actually be the best choice. And with Rivian’s new lease offer starting at $599/month for the R1 Dual-Motor with the Standard pack, it’s never been a more affordable way to get behind the wheel of one.\nFirst off, it’s the cheapest option. And let’s be real—Rivians aren’t exactly budget-friendly. If you can save a chunk of cash and still get plenty of range for daily driving, why wouldn’t you? Unless you’re regularly doing cross-country road trips with zero charging stops, the Standard pack gives you all the range you actually need.\nRivian’s New Lease Offer R1 Dual Standard Starting at $599/Month\nThen there’s the battery tech. LFP batteries are tougher, last longer, and don’t degrade as fast—especially if you fast charge a lot. Plus, unlike the other packs that prefer to stay between 20-80%, the Standard pack wants to be charged to 100% regularly. That means no worrying about keeping it in a “sweet spot” all the time. Just plug it in, fill it up, and go.\nIt’s also the lightest pack, which means better efficiency and handling. And while Rivian hasn’t shared exact weight differences, less weight is always a win.\nUnless you absolutely need 350+ miles of range on a single charge, the Standard pack is probably the best choice. It’s cheaper, tougher, and easier to charge.\nRange comparison between the most popular battery variants\nWould you go for the Standard pack, or do you think bigger is better?\n One comment \n Why dont all models have the LFP batteries if they are better\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
