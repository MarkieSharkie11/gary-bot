  "text": "Rivian Software Updates: When You'll Get Yours & How It Actually Works\n Last updated: December 21, 2025\n How Rivian rolls out software updates — wave distribution, download methods, and what actually affects when you'll get yours.\n The Short Version\n Connect+ moves you up, not to the front — still ~3 days from release\n Rollouts happen on business days — no weekend or holiday pushes\n Parking on WiFi won't get you flagged sooner — flagging is Rivian's call; WiFi just speeds up the download after\n Queue position is random — location, order date, mileage don't matter\n The Rivian app won't show anything at flagging — it waits until download completes; Rivian Roamer alerts earlier\n Software Update Process Overview\n Release\n Flagging\n 1-5 days\n Download\n 30min-8h\n Verification\n ~20 min\n Installation\n ~45 min\n Completion\n Each step of the update process is explained in detail below.\n 1\n Software Release\n Rivian regularly releases software updates with new features and improvements. These updates are typically distributed in waves over a ~5-day period.\n Wave Distribution System\n 1\n First ~3 Days: Connect+ subscribers and trial users receive priority in early waves\n 2\n Final ~2 Days: Remaining vehicles receive the update\n Early\n Connect+\n Middle\n Connect+\n Later\n All\n Wave Propagation\n Earlier waves include only a small percentage of the fleet, creating a natural probability of most owners being in later waves\n Each subsequent wave includes a larger percentage of vehicles until all eligible vehicles are covered\n This gradual approach helps Rivian detect any issues early before wider distribution\n Technical Facts\n WiFi connection, location, and order date have no impact on when you'll be flagged\n Selection within waves is random\n 2\n Vehicle Flagging\n 1-5 days\n When your vehicle is selected in a wave, it gets \"flagged\" for the update on Rivian's servers.\n This happens automatically whether your vehicle is online or offline.\n Important: The Rivian mobile app provides no indication when your vehicle is flagged. You'll only know your vehicle has been flagged by either checking your vehicle's center display or through Rivian Roamer with a linked account.\n Get Early Notifications\n Rivian Roamer users with linked accounts receive immediate notifications when their vehicle is flagged, giving you time to plan for download and installation.\n Be the first to know about updates!\n Sign Up Free\n 3\n Download Process\n WiFi: 30min-2h\n After being flagged, your vehicle needs to download the update package. There are two main ways this happens:\n WiFi\n Recommended\n Speed:\n Fastest option\n Time:\n 30 min - 2 hours\n For:\n All users\n Note: Flagged vehicles start downloading immediately when connected to WiFi. Mobile hotspots work too!\n Cellular\n Slower\n Speed:\n Much slower\n Time:\n 1 - 8 hours\n For:\n Connect+ subscribers and trial users\n Note: Serves as fallback if WiFi fails after a few attempts. Emergency updates may use cellular for all vehicles.\n Key Download Information\n Update packages are typically multi-GB in size\n Connection errors may resolve automatically\n Rivian Roamer users: Track download progress in real-time on your dashboard.\n Seeing \"Connection Lost\"? Check the troubleshooting section.\n 4\n Verification\n ~20 min\n Once downloaded, your vehicle verifies the update package before installation.\n Verification Process\n Post-download integrity verification\n Security signature validation\n Installation package preparation\n Official Rivian app notification occurs after this stage\n This process happens automatically and requires no user interaction.\n 5\n Installation\n ~45 min\n When your update is ready to install, you can initiate it from the Rivian mobile app, your vehicle's touchscreen, or it will install automatically if you've enabled scheduled software updates. Regardless of method, these requirements must be met:\n Installation Requirements\n Vehicle in Park\n 35+ miles of range\n Not connected to DC fast charger\n Pet Mode disabled\n Tire Change Mode disabled\n 12V battery is healthy\n What to Expect During Installation\n Strange sounds may occur, this is normal\n In-vehicle screens may be temporarily off or unresponsive\n Vehicle controls, including locks may be unresponsive\n Mobile app control unavailable during installation\n 6\n Completion\n After installation completes and your vehicle restarts, you'll be running the latest software.\n Follow on-screen prompts for a guided update experience.\n Consider bringing your key fob to the vehicle after an update, as it may receive updates when in proximity to the vehicle.\n See what's new in recent releases\n Rivian Autonomy+ Data Updates\n Separate from main vehicle software updates, Rivian Autonomy+ (RAP) data updates download in the background whenever your Gen 2 vehicle (2025+) is connected to WiFi. These background downloads operate independently of regular software updates.\n Downloads automatically in the background\n Installs without notification or vehicle restart\n Troubleshooting\n Connection Issues\n If you see Connection Lost status, follow these steps:\n Verify WiFi signal strength\n Try alternate WiFi network\n Connect+ users: try disabling WiFi to force cellular download\n Last resort: perform steering wheel button reset\n Installation Problems\n If installation fails, try these solutions:\n Verify all prerequisites met\n Wait 24 hours before retrying\n Ensure adequate connectivity\n Contact Rivian support for persistent issues\n Never Miss an Update\n Sign up for Rivian Roamer to get early update notifications as soon as your vehicle is flagged.
