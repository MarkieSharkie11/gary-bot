  "title": "Why Rivian R2’s Success Matters to Every R1 Owner",
  "text": "Skip to content\nEvery time R2 comes up, I hear some version of the same question from R1 owners: should I be worried?\nShort answer, no. Longer answer, also no, but let’s talk about why because this is one of those moments where perspective really matters.\nR1 owners tend to forget just how much weight they carry in Rivian’s story. R1 was never meant to be the mass market car. It was the proof point. It showed the world that Rivian could actually build something special, something different, and support it in the real world. Without R1, there is no R2. Full stop.\nR2 does not replace R1. It complements it. And more importantly, it protects it.\nIf you own an R1, R2 succeeding is probably the best possible outcome for you. A higher volume vehicle means more revenue, more stability, and more leverage for Rivian to keep investing in software, service, and infrastructure. That stuff does not magically appear. It is funded by scale, and R2 is how Rivian gets there.\nSoftware is where things get interesting. More vehicles on the road means more data, more edge cases, and more pressure to clean things up internally. We already saw how bumpy things got when Rivian had to juggle Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1. Adding R2 into the mix raises the difficulty level, no question. But if Rivian nails this, R1 owners benefit directly. Faster fixes, better prioritization, and fewer half baked features slipping through.\nThe fear that R1 owners will be ignored once R2 launches is understandable, but I think it misses the bigger picture. R1 buyers are still Rivian’s premium audience. They are the ones pushing limits, towing, off roading, road tripping, and generally stress testing the platform. That feedback is invaluable. Ignoring it would be borderline reckless.\nResale value comes up a lot too, and I think this one gets overblown. R2 is expected to be smaller, cheaper, and aimed at a totally different buyer. Someone shopping an R1 is not suddenly going to look at an R2 and say close enough. If anything, R2 expands the funnel. More people fall in love with the brand, more people aspire to move up, and that helps the entire lineup long term.\nThere is also something kind of cool about this moment. R1 owners helped define Rivian’s personality. The weirdness, the adventure angle, Gear Guard being unapologetically fun. Seeing that DNA show up in R2 is not dilution, it is validation. Those ideas worked. They are worth scaling.\nR1 proved Rivian could build a great vehicle. R2 will decide whether Rivian can become a great company.\nAnd if you are an R1 owner, that outcome is very much in your favor.\n 5 Comments \n Back in March 31st I put down $100 reservation of the R2\nWhen & how will I be notified when its my turn to build out my R2\n Log into your Rivian account. Or create one and you email address will link to your deposit\n We need R2 to succeed so R3 can happen!\n You didn’t get in trouble for pirating a Pearl Jam song while in college in NY, did you? I ask because we share the exact same name, and out of the blue one day ~30 years ago I started getting DMCA and FBI letters (I’m from Seattle, Pearl Jam’s home) even though I never pirated any of their music. I almost couldn’t join the military because my/your/our name(s) is/was/were “flagged” in some way even though I never did anything to warrant such treatment.\nJust curious! If you are that guy, you may have prevented me from getting a job at Engadget, and possibly even from buying an original Mini Cooper. Just odd coincidences. Cheers!\n The R1 was indeed meant to be a mass-produced vehicle. The factory was built to run 150,000 units per year. The story about R1 being the premium “handshake with the world” was revisionism to cover up production difficulties and sagging demand.\n Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
