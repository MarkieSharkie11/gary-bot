  "text": "Skip to content\nRivian is returning to SXSW in 2026 as a headline partner for the second consecutive year, and this time the spotlight is clearly on R2.\nAfter making a strong impression at SXSW in 2025, Rivian’s continued headline presence signals that the partnership is becoming a long term platform for the brand rather than a one off appearance. Anchored once again by the Electric Roadhouse in Austin, Rivian will use the festival to showcase its next phase of growth, with R2 positioned as the centerpiece.\nSXSW’s mix of technology, culture, and creativity makes it an ideal stage for R2, Rivian’s upcoming midsize SUV designed to bring the brand to a much broader audience. With production approaching, Rivian headlining SXSW for a second year gives the company a high visibility moment to keep building momentum and familiarity around R2 ahead of launch.\nWhile Rivian has not yet shared full programming details, attendees can expect immersive brand experiences, vehicle displays, and conversations around sustainability and mobility, all framed around R2 and what it represents for Rivian’s future.\nRivian returning as a SXSW headliner for a second year reinforces how central R2 is to the company’s next chapter, and how intentionally Rivian is placing it in front of audiences that live at the intersection of tech, culture, and innovation.\nRivian is also hosting a contest where you can enter for your chance to win a hotel stay during SXSW and 2 Platinum Badges.
